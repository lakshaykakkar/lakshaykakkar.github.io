In collaboration with planning teams at the Airports Authority of India, I designed a data and optimisation workflow that helps leaders make evidence-backed slot allocation decisions.

Key contributions include:

- Integrating heterogeneous data sources (traffic movement, service level agreements, infrastructure constraints) into a unified SQL and Python pipeline.
- Developing scenario simulators and dashboards that surface utilisation trends, congestion risks, and regulatory compliance in Tableau and Power BI.
- Prototyping mixed-integer optimisation models that balance capacity, fairness, and airline commitments.
- Establishing documentation and reproducibility standards so that operations teams can easily adapt the toolkit across airports.

The toolkit is now piloted within multiple metro airports to streamline planning cycles and highlight opportunities for passenger experience improvements.
