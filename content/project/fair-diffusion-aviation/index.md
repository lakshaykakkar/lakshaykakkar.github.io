This ongoing MS(Research) work investigates how diffusion models can be adapted to generate representative synthetic aerial imagery that augments data-scarce perception tasks.

Research highlights:

- Surveyed regularisation, conditioning, and controllability techniques for diffusion and score-based models.
- Experimented with guidance strategies that maintain demographic diversity and geographic coverage without sacrificing fidelity.
- Designed evaluation frameworks combining FID scores with fairness metrics to monitor bias drift across generated samples.
- Drafted reproducible pipelines that integrate with downstream detection models used in airport safety and planning studies.

The project aims to produce guidelines and open-source tooling that help public infrastructure agencies adopt generative models responsibly.
