As part of **Statistical Learning II (Spring 2024)**, I led a comprehensive fairness evaluation of convolutional neural networks trained on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). The project involved:

- Building reproducible training and evaluation pipelines in PyTorch with robust experiment tracking.
- Quantifying demographic parity, equalised odds, and subgroup accuracy across synthetic driver demographics.
- Comparing mitigation strategies including reweighing, focal loss adjustments, and feature perturbations.
- Summarising actionable guidance for deploying safer traffic sign recognition systems in public infrastructure projects.

The study culminated in a live demonstration and a detailed report discussing policy implications for intelligent transport systems.
